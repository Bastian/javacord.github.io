## Running from your IDE

While developing your bot, you will want to run your bot directly from the IDE in order to quickly test changes and new features. For this, create a Run/Debug Configuration in your IDE of choice with your bots main class. Remember to also add any necessary parameters and environment variables.

### IntelliJ IDEA

This assumes your project is set up correctly, preferably with [Gradle](/wiki/getting-started/intellij-gradle), can be built without errors, and does not yet have any run/debug configurations.

**1.** Locate and click the `Add Configuration...` button at the top bar next to the start button.

**2.** Another window opens. Click the `+` button in the top left and select `Application`

**3.** Give a name for your configuration and select the module to use the classpath of (usually `yourproject.main`).

**4.** Select your Main class. Use the `...` button to search for it or provide the fully qualified name. If it can not be found, you most likely selected the wrong module in step 3.

**5.** Optional: Set command line arguments and environment variables. For the environment variables, use the button to the right of the input field for a more convenient input window.

**6.** Click `Apply` to finalize the configuration, then `OK` to close the window.

**7.** Select your configuration in the drop down menu and run or debug it with the buttons to the right.

## Running as a standalone application

Running from the IDE is only recommended during development and strongly discouraged for production use. Generally you'll want your build tool to create a convenient distribution for you to use.

### Building a distribution with gradle

For gradle, only two further steps are necessary for a basic application. On top of the steps described in the [Getting Started Section](/wiki/getting-started/intellij-gradle), also add the [Application Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html) and define your `mainClassName` as the fully qualified name of your main class. Since the `application` plugin implicitly applies the `java` plugin, you may leave that one out.

Your modified `build.gradle` file should now look like this.
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'application'
}

group 'com.github.yourname'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

sourceCompatibility = 1.8

application {
    mainClassName = 'com.github.yourname.BotMain'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.javacord:javacord:${latest-version}'
}
```

Now you can execute the `distZip` or `distTar` task with gradle. The task will create a distribution and package it in an archive file that will be placed in the `build/distributions` directory. Extract the content of those files on your server or whichever machine you want to run your bot on.

The distribution usually only contains the directories `bin` and `lib`. From the distribution directory, run either `bin/yourbot` or `bin/yourbot.bat`, depending on whether you're running the bot on linux or windows.

### Building a distribution with maven

For maven, add the [Appassembler](https://www.mojohaus.org/appassembler/appassembler-maven-plugin/usage-program.html) plugin to your `pom.xml`.

```xml
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>appassembler-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.10</version>
        <configuration>
          <programs>
            <program>
              <mainClass>com.github.yourname.BotMain</mainClass>
              <id>yourbot</id>
            </program>
          </programs>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

Now you can use the `appassembler:assemble` target, for example with the invocation `mvn package appassembler:assemble`. Unlike the gradle plugin, Appassembler will not create an archive file, so you will have to create one manually or just copy the contents of the `target/appassembler` directory manually.

### Running

After creating your distribution via gradle or maven and extracting/copying it to the machine you want to run it from, you should have a directory containing both a `bin` and a `lib` directory. Depending on your platform, you can now run the `bin/yourbot` or `bin/yourbot.bat` script.

These automatically generated scripts will then invoke java with your dependencies on the classpath and run your main class. Your working directory will be the one you ran the script from.

## Building a fat jar

Although it is an abuse of the way java works, sometimes you will be forced to create a fat jar - an executable jar that contains your application and all its dependencies. This is sometimes used as a lazy way of building a convenient distribution, but should be foregone in favor of the above mentioned distributions.

However, in some cases (more often than not Bukkit/Spigot addons) it is necessary to provide a fat jar, since the host applications loading mechanism can only handle singular jar files.

### With gradle

For gradle, use the `Shadow` plugin. You will have to modify the build scripts classpath for this.

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.jengelman.gradle.plugins:shadow:2.8.1'
    }
}

plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow'
}
```

With `gradlew shadowJar` you can now create a shaded (fat) jar.

### With maven

For maven, add the [maven-shade-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/usage.html) to your build.

```xml
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.2.3</version>
        <configuration>
            <shadedArtifactAttached>true</shadedArtifactAttached>
            <shadedClassifierName>fat</shadedClassifierName>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

Running `mvn package` will now additionally create the `yourbot-fat.jar`.
